Here's the script to make the circle bounce away from the predator when they collide:

```csharp
public class CollisionHandler : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float bounceForce = 10f;
    private Rigidbody2D rb;

    void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
    }

    void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision)
    {
        if (collision.gameObject.CompareTag("Predator"))
        {
            // Calculate bounce direction away from predator
            Vector2 bounceDirection = (transform.position - collision.transform.position).normalized;
            
            // Reset velocity before applying bounce
            rb.velocity = Vector2.zero;
            
            // Apply bounce force
            rb.AddForce(bounceDirection * bounceForce, ForceMode2D.Impulse);
            
            // Decrement life count
            GameManager.Instance.DecrementLives();
        }
    }
}
```

This script should be attached to the player's circle object and works by:
1. Calculating the direction vector from the predator to the player when collision occurs[2][6]
2. Applying an immediate force in that direction using ForceMode2D.Impulse[3]
3. Resetting the current velocity before applying the bounce to ensure consistent behavior[5]

Make sure to:
1. Tag the predator object with "Predator" tag in the Unity Inspector
2. Adjust the bounceForce value to control how far the circle bounces away[4]
3. Ensure both objects have their Rigidbody2D components properly configured[2]

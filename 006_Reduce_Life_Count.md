Here's how to implement a function to reduce player lives effectively:

## Core Implementation

**Basic Function Structure**:
```python
def reduce_lives(self):
    if self.lives > 0:
        self.lives -= 1
        self.update_lives_display()
        
        if self.lives == 0:
            self.game_over()
```

## Key Considerations

**Prevent Multiple Deductions**:
- Only reduce lives once per collision/death event[1][23]
- Use a collision flag to prevent multiple deductions during continuous contact:
```python
if player.collides_with_enemy and not self.collision_flag:
    self.collision_flag = True
    self.reduce_lives()
elif not player.collides_with_enemy:
    self.collision_flag = False
```

**Recovery Period**:
- Implement temporary invulnerability after losing a life[1]
- Reset player position or state when lives are reduced[3]
- Allow time for death animation before respawning[5]

## Best Practices

**State Management**:
- Track current lives with a dedicated variable[4]
- Set a maximum lives limit (typically 3-5 lives)[1]
- Store lives count separately from other game states[9]

**Player Feedback**:
- Display remaining lives visually (icons/counter)[3]
- Provide clear feedback when lives are lost[1]
- Show game over screen when lives reach zero[4]

**Balance Considerations**:
- Don't punish players too harshly early in the game[1]
- Consider providing extra lives as rewards[1]
- Allow players to restart from checkpoints rather than the beginning[4]

This implementation provides a robust foundation for managing player lives while maintaining good game design principles and player experience.
